## Accessible Terminology
In the interest of keeping our project as accessible to as many people as possible, we try to use terms that are as clear and direct in their meaning as possible. 
As a result, literal terminology is to be preferred over metaphorical language or jargon. For example:
*Blocklist* is preferred to *blacklist*
*Allowlist* is preferred to *whitelist*
*Master/Slave* should be replaced with terms that more precisely illustrate the relationship between two components, e.g. "Primary / Secondary," "Controller/Agent" "Main / Dependent" or similar.
